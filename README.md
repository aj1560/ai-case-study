# Juniper Mist - An AI driven network solution

## Overview and Origin
Juniper Networks Inc. (AKA Juniper) is one of the leaders in network industry for the last couple of decades. It was founded in early 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu, Dennis Ferguson and Bjorn Liencres. This paper  is focused on “Juniper Mist” which is Juniper’s foray into using AI for networks and it has its own history. 

Mist Systems Inc. was founded and incorporated in 2014 by Sujai Hajela (CEO) and Bob Friday (CTO).  Sujai and Bob both came from Cisco and had deep knowledge of network technologies. They thought of using the information available in wireless systems as the inputs to ML models and developing AI driven networks. They raised $108M over 4 years with some of the investors being Lightstream Venture Partners, Dimension Data, Google and Cisco.

The problem statement/idea for the company was : *How can we get wireless networks to be more automated, self correcting and require least human intervention for the installation and the ongoing operations.* 

When Mist was founded in 2014, Enterprise networks were facing the challenges of being the roadblocks to business evolution. All the solutions in the market addressed networks in a nearly identical fashion - copious amounts of network hardware, monitor, manage, truck rolls, upgrade, replace, rinse and repeat. All of these actions required manual intervention and as such the lifecycle for networks was 8-10 years at a minimum, making network transformation a dreaded term that involved a significant cost, time and risk to business. If an organization decided to go with transformation they would end up with still the same problems they had in the old network - static and largely dependent on human intervention.
